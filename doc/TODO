- Fix map program
    - With map, also pass list of distances, angles between points
- Rewrite sensor.java
    - Sense points to degree of precision defined by normal distribution
      around point with given SD
        - Loop through all points on map
        - Identify points within range
        - Apply normal distribution of error to position
    - Measure distances between detected points if more than 1 detected
        - 2 nested loops through list of detected points finding the distance
          between each point found. 
        - Drop each distance in a 2-dimensional array
        - Figure out the maximum acceptable variation in distance from movement?
          and sensor error
    - Measure angle between points if more than 2 detected
        - Measure side lengths
        - Measure 2 angles
            - For every group of three vectors
                - Find vector components of 2 vectors between points
                - Transform vector components into Magnitude/Direction
                - Take abs() of difference between angles
                - Drop each angle in 3-dimensional array
        - Find last by subtracting from 180
    - Find points with close-enough distance and angle
        - Loop through distances, find similar distances
        - If 3 or more points found, loop through angles, find similar angles
          that involve the same points
    - Make guess (or array of guesses)
